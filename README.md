# executable-program-bomberman

Important!!!

The package "jre1.8.0_91" is Java Runtime Environment since the program is wrote in Java

It is quit big to download (156MB)

If you have a jre in your computer, you can try to only download image.zip and bomberman.exe under the same file path

Unzip image.zip in the original file path and run the bomberman.exe

If it doesn't work, perhaps you can try to copy your jre package in the same file path

The exe program is generated by exe4j
