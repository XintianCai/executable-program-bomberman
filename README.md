# executable-program-bomberman

Important!!!

You need to download the whole folder to run the bomberman.exe. All the files are necessary, and the file path cannot be changed

The package "jre1.8.0_91" is the Java Runtime Environment since the program is wrote in Java. It is quit big to download (156MB), but it is necessary for running the program

Or you can simply download the "game demo video.mp4" to see how the game is played

-The exe program is generated by exe4j
